# Computational Methods for Macroeconomic Modeling

![](qe-logo-large.png)

## Abstract

Scientific computing has advanced rapidly in recent years years, driven in large
part by demand from and investment in artificial intelligence hardware and
software. Much of this investment has centered on parallelization, automatic
differentiation, and just-in-time compilers. In this workshop, we will explore
these new environments and their features, and investigate how such tools might
be applied to macroeconomic applications.  The focus will be foundational and
numerical, emphasizing understanding of new computing environments and numerical
methods rather than particular models or modeling paradigms.

## Additional Information

We will do some live coding and exercises.  Attendees should bring laptops. For
those who wish to prepare, the first few [QuantEcon
lectures](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) will be helpful.
